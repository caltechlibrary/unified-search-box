# Limitations of current prototype.

This is a proof of concept unified search box. Currently it is only a functional prototype (e.g. zero design was implemented in CSS).

As a prototype two searches remain illusive to effectively include. 

1. Our e-Journals search is hosted in SFX but that requires a session id to be generated before returning results so I am linking directly to the SFX page
2. I Journals collection is also catalog in our ILMS which is scheduled for replacement. The existing API does not allow for narrowing the search to serials only. This may change in the new ILMS based on Invenio. Invenio has a more flexibly (and documented) API.  Present work around is to include more than serials in the search results
