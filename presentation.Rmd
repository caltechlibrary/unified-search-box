# a unified search box

# backstory

I am relatively new to Caltech Library and modern library systems (since April 2015). I have been building things for the web since Lynx, NCSA web server and Mosiac. I still have lots to learn (and that makes it fun).

---

# the problem

+ The library has many search systems
+ Useful for Librarians or to bookmark
+ But many patrons prefer a one-box search approach

---

# a solution?

Our Librarians spotted a solution

MIT Library has a nice implementation close to what we need

+ [MIT Library](http://libraries.mit.edu/)
    + Implemented in [Wordpress](http://libraries.mit.edu/feed/)
    + Relies on jQuery

But not exactly suited to the current evolution of [library.caltech.edu](https://library.caltech.edu)

---

# some constraints

+ We were planning a complete website re-design but that was 3 to 9 months out
    + this project was needed in the interum
+ Our infrastructure is rather organic
    + this suggested an evolutionary approach
    + but we couldn't assume Wordpress/Drupal at this stage
    + I didn't know what browsers and versions we needed to support
+ I did know I needed to support browsers which may have JS turned off 
    + or were just really stale (I'm looking at you IE 6)

---

# initial technical choices

+ Progressively enhance from no-JS to evergreen browsers
    + Default links to individual search pages in NOSCRIPT element for no-JS
    + Use JS to load MIT like implementation
    + Come up with a browser support baseline
+ Rely on CSS as much as possible
+ Build everything staticly
+ Take an iterative approach through prototyping
+ Put configuration of the unified search box into the HTML data attributes 
    + spoiler alert: this didn't work out as I expected

---

# graded browsers support

+ Approach was made popular at Yahoo many years ago
+ It lets you breakdown the browser support challenges into something manageable
+ It can be revised moving forward
+ Historically based on the browser versions/types identified accessing your website
+ Today you decide based browser capabilities
    + typically the minimum set of capabilities you need to implement

---

# three browser grades

+ Our Grade A browser have to support
    + `document.querySelector()` and `document.querySelectorAll()`
        + Desktop: IE 10/Edge 13, Firefox 42, Chrome 47, Safari 9
        + Mobile: iOS Safari 9.2, Chrome for Android 47
+ Grade B, browsers with JS disabled (or not available)
+ Grade C, everything else to be addressed as time permits

---

# impact on implementation

1. Grade C leveraging this highly technical software secret... you punt

Enter the [Nac Mac Feegle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nac_Mac_Feegle)  
![Nac Mac Feegle](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/8f/85/7f/8f857fa95369d42abe7e437cf6bef171.jpg)   
Wring your hands, pull your hair, and wave your arms while shouting, "oh wally, wally, I knean this would happen..." 

2. You start by implementing Grade B 
    + Quick and easy, just HTML and a dusting of CSS
3. Then you then implement Grade A 
    + start with one browser, moved to the next in the list
    + make time to revisit each browser with each new version released
    + this takes a while

---

# prototypes

+ This project went through five [prototypes](http://caltechlibrary.github.io/unified-search-box/index.html)
+ All hosted on Github
    + Easy to share, edit and deploy
    + Supports static file hosting which is nice for prototyping
    + Did I say easy to share, edit and deploy from? 8^)

# why prototype?

"All projects have at least one catch", Steve Doiel (1936 -- 2006)

"Fail early when the costs are low", Silicon Valley ethos

1. Gives you, the developer, space to learn and work the problem
2. Gives you permission to really find out what the requirements are
3. Provides a sense of progress and discovery for your client

# GOTCHAS!
## Browser side

+ My original plan to use data attributes to pass configuration was not reasonable (EBSCO I'm looking at you)
    + I switched to a JavaScript data structure
    + Configuration could also have been implemented as a JSON blob (might make sense if we generalize this widget)
+ CSS can still be really painful thing to debug
    + Implementing the production version required re-working the CSS to work with the rest of the page
    + This left me with some ugly, long id and class names (CSS lacks namespacing)
    + In the future I'll take the [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) approach
+ Each Browser security release triggers another round of browser testing
    + It would be good to automate as much of this as possible
    + I relied on a human readable test list

# GOTCHAS!
## Server side

+ CORS now widely supported but not necessarily configured in systems
    + wrapping pages in PHP to generate appropraite CORS header was easy short term fix
+ I wanted SSL straight through vs. non-SSL for some searches in legacy implementation
+ This required a new set of wild cards CERT in our proxy server
    + without that some CSS and JavaScript inclusion was broken
    + that change impacted other systems that also used the proxy
    + that required coordination

Thank you Betsy for coming to the rescue!!!

---

# revised implementation choices

+ Configuration moved from data attributes in HTML to JavaScript data structure
+ Used a web components approach but implemented as old-school HTML+CSS+JS
+ Deployed in phases

---

# Present project status

+ [v1](https://library.caltech.edu/index.php) has been in use since early Fall
+ [v2](https://library.caltech.edu/index-beta.php) EDS support being tested now
    + Scheduled for general deployment Dec 21st after finals but before Winter break

---

# road map

+ [V2 Beta](https://library.caltech.edu/index-beta.php) becomes production version
+ V3 adding some requested features (e.g. sticky search option selection)
+ V4? turn into a Web Component?
