This should probably go in a basecamp project but I don’t have rights to create one. So here’s my current general list of things to be dealt with

## UI behavior issues (JS)

+ Clicking anywhere on the filter menu box should select the LI not just on the anchor itself, attaching the event listener to the LI isn't making a difference on Windows Firefox according to K.B. 2015-10-13

## UI visual issues (CSS)

+ The 'select box' should open/close on mouse hover, this should be added via CSS, prototyp1 on caltechlibrary.github.io has some experiments that maybe helpful.
